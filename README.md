# ColorConverter Extension for Nova

This extension adds commands for converting colors from one display type to another

Currently supports converting back and forth between hex (e.g. '#d34579') and rgb (e.g. (211,69,121)), with alpha values supported from both ends. Both RGBA and ARGB formats are supported.
